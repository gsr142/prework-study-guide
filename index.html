        <ul>
          <li>The git command must precede every Git statement.</li>
          <li>The checkout command is to move the working branch to a new branch.</li>
          <li>The -b flag creates a new branch.</li>
          <li>We have added the prefix, feature, to indicate that it is a feature. 
            It is good practice to name the branches for the feature that will 
            be developed by them to help indicate the purpose of each branch.</li>
          
          <li>Always ensure you are working on the correct branch, avoid coding directly on main or master.</li>
          <li>Create feature branch to maintain main/master, and track changes made via feature branches.</li>
          <li>A pull request, or PR, is used to merge a comparison branch (in our case, the feature branch) into the base branch.</li>
          <li>Steps for version control<ol>
            <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
            <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
            <li>git status: verify that you are working on feature branch</li>
            <li>Write your code</li>
            <li>git add -A: The add command adds modifications in the current working branch to the staging area. -A indicates we
              want to add all changes. The changes are now staged to be committed.</li>
            <li>git commit -m "add code": This command captures a snapshot of the currently staged changes, once committed,
              the feature branch will be updated with the starter code.</li>
            <li>git pull origin main: We need to double check that our local branch is synced with the base branch in github. 
              this command pulls any changes from the base branch, and ensures we are working on updated code.</li>
            <li>git push origin feature/starter-code: This command pushes the local changes we have made, to the remote Github branch.</li>
            <li>Go to the repository on Github, main brainch will be displayed by default. Select you feature branch from the dropdown,
              and click on the "Compare and pull request" button.</li>
            <li>Give the PR a descriptive title. In the body, add instructions for the team to review the changes, functionality, and 
              testing.</li>
            <li>Designate the base branch as "main", and the comparison branch as your feature branch.</li>
            <li>Click on the "Create pull request" button.</li>
            <li>Once the feature branch has been reviewed and is ready to merge with the main branch, click the 
              "Merge pull request" button.</li>
